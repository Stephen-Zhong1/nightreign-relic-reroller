# How to use Nightreign Relic Reroller
So I have a shiny new download of Relic Reroller. How do I start? 
Navigate this guide using the Outline button in the upper right. If nothing else, at least read the Useful Info and Warnings section.

**I strongly recommend you play in 1920x1080 resolution and Borderless Windowed while using this tool**

## Creating a Relic Preset
You will first want to create a (or multiple) Relic Preset that the app will attempt to roll for you.

</p>

This will create a new empty Relic Preset.

  <img width="426" height="325" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 142507" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/224aaebe-6a63-400b-861a-ea72777f6100" />
</p>

</p>
1. Depth Checkbox: This determines whether or not this Relic Preset is a Depth Relic. Depth Relics have different effects and also the option to pick curses to exclude. A Depth Relic Preset will be skipped when rolling normal relics and vice versa.
2. Name: Editable text field to name your Relic Preset
3. Edit: Opens a new window to edit your Relic Preset
4. Delete: Opens a confirmation window to delete your Relic Preset

You can create as many Relic Presets as you want, and also save and load them at any time with the "Save Setup" and "Load Setup" options. These options will save/load all current Relic Presets. 
Beware that these options will also save/load your settings. Be sure to check them before going to roll.

</p>

## Customizing your Relic Preset
So I've clicked **Edit Relic Preset**. This will pull up a new window to select effects for your Relic Preset.

<p align="center">
  <img width="558" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/069bae43-43ae-4014-899f-39aa821635b7" />
</p>

Now we must select effects for each slot of the Relic Preset. Clicking **Edit Relic Effects** will allow you to select effects for the slot that you picked. You can select any number of effects. 
Beware that selecting too many for too many different relics can significantly slow down how fast the app runs. 
I am a Recluse main. Let's say I want to roll a relic that powers up Crystalian and Carian sorceries. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" height="327" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888ef06b-c094-4557-b6aa-6a2ad36f47f0" />
</p>

My Relic Preset now has a slot that looks for either Improved Crystalian or Carian Sword Sorceries. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="558" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb8ce8a-c460-41e1-b8f0-810378e6fc5a" />
</p>

Let's say I'm very greedy and want more than that. I want a godroll that has one of those bonuses as well as another useful bonus. I will edit the relic effects of the second slot of my Relic Preset.

<p align="center">
  <img width="555" height="444" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 144712" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ea6b666-d6aa-4374-ad11-29f79dfd649b" />
</p>

I now have a Relic Preset for Crystalian or Carian Sword Recluse. I can confirm my effect selection and come back to it whenever by going back to **Edit Relic Roll** for that Relic Preset.

For Depth Relics, there will be an extra Curses section. 


<p align="center">
  <img width="548" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd73b46d-785a-43ad-b275-ffade8edac7e" />
</p>

If a relic contains any of the selected curses, it will be marked as invalid. 


## Settings
Settings can be accessed by using the left-most "Settings" button. There are currently 4 settings.

1. Number of Times to Reroll: This means how many times the Relic Reroller will buy relics. For example, putting 2 in this field will buy 10 relics twice making 20 relics total. Beware that this tool will always try to buy 10 relics.
2. Type of Relic Roll: Normal/Depth are your options. Normal option will attempt to roll normal relics that match normal (non-depth) Relic Presets and vice versa for Depth.
3. Auto-delete Relics without 3 Perks: Does what it says on the tin. Like manual rerolling, I encourage you not to do this but it will significantly speed up the rolling especially if you have many Relic Presets with many effects.
