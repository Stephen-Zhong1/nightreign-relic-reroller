# How to use Nightreign Relic Reroller
So I have a shiny new download of Relic Reroller. How do I start? 
Navigate this guide using the Outline button in the upper right. If nothing else, at least read the Useful Info and Warnings section.

**I strongly recommend you play in 1920x1080 resolution and Borderless Windowed while using this tool**

## Creating a Relic Preset
You will first want to create a (or multiple) Relic Preset that the app will attempt to roll for you. 

<p align="center">

</p>

This will create a new empty Relic Preset.

<p align="center">
  <img width="425" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa19db69-a36a-420b-a4f0-f46e3bcbdcbd" />
  <img width="426" height="325" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 142507" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/224aaebe-6a63-400b-861a-ea72777f6100" />
</p>

1. Depth Checkbox: This determines whether or not this Relic Preset is a Depth Relic. Depth Relics have different effects and also the option to pick curses to exclude. A Depth Relic Preset will be skipped when rolling normal relics and vice versa.
2. Name: Editable text field to name your Relic Preset
3. Edit: Opens a new window to edit your Relic Preset
4. Delete: Opens a confirmation window to delete your Relic Preset

You can create as many Relic Presets as you want, and also save and load them at any time with the "Save Setup" and "Load Setup" options. These options will save/load all current Relic Presets. 
Beware that these options will also save/load your settings. Be sure to check them before going to roll.
<p align="center">
  <img width="428" height="327" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 143250" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84537e09-6ac8-43cd-b489-dabae551e1e3" />
</p>

## Customizing your Relic Preset
So I've clicked **Edit Relic Preset**. This will pull up a new window to select effects for your Relic Preset.

<p align="center">
  <img width="558" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/069bae43-43ae-4014-899f-39aa821635b7" />
</p>

Now we must select effects for each slot of the Relic Preset. Clicking **Edit Relic Effects** will allow you to select effects for the slot that you picked. You can select any number of effects. 
Beware that selecting too many for too many different relics can significantly slow down how fast the app runs. 
I am a Recluse main. Let's say I want to roll a relic that powers up Crystalian and Carian sorceries. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" height="327" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888ef06b-c094-4557-b6aa-6a2ad36f47f0" />
</p>

My Relic Preset now has a slot that looks for either Improved Crystalian or Carian Sword Sorceries. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="558" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb8ce8a-c460-41e1-b8f0-810378e6fc5a" />
</p>

Let's say I'm very greedy and want more than that. I want a godroll that has one of those bonuses as well as another useful bonus. I will edit the relic effects of the second slot of my Relic Preset.

<p align="center">
  <img width="555" height="444" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 144712" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ea6b666-d6aa-4374-ad11-29f79dfd649b" />
</p>

I now have a Relic Preset for Crystalian or Carian Sword Recluse. I can confirm my effect selection and come back to it whenever by going back to **Edit Relic Roll** for that Relic Preset. This Relic Preset will now attempt to roll a relic that:
* Contains Crystalian **OR** Carian Sword Sorcery up
* Contains a Recluse specific perk **OR** Rise FP **OR** Magic Attack Up

For example: A relic containing (Carian Sorcery+, Rise FP, random effect) is valid. A relic containing (Recluse perk, Rise FP, random effect) is not valid.

For Depth Relics, there will be an extra Curses section. 


<p align="center">
  <img width="548" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd73b46d-785a-43ad-b275-ffade8edac7e" />
</p>

If a relic contains any of the selected curses, it will be marked as invalid, even if it otherwise satisfies all relic effects.


## Settings
Settings can be accessed by using the left-most "Settings" button. There are currently 4 settings.


<p align="center">
  <img width="356" height="162" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 145831" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2631f28-6de4-41b5-a979-3346060530a7" />
</p>

1. Number of Times to Reroll: This means how many times the Relic Reroller will buy relics. For example, putting 2 in this field will buy 10 relics twice making 20 relics total. Beware that this tool will always try to buy 10 relics.
2. Type of Relic Roll: Normal/Depth are your options. Normal option will attempt to roll normal relics that match normal (non-depth) Relic Presets and vice versa for Depth.
3. Auto-delete Relics without 3 Perks: Does what it says on the tin. Like manual rerolling, I encourage you not to do this but it will significantly speed up the rolling especially if you have many Relic Presets with many effects.
4. Confirmation Window when Rolling Valid Relic: If checked, this option will bring up a window that requires you to confirm whenever the program finds a relic that satisfies one of your Presets. I encourage you to use this so that the program does not consume all your murk in one day.

## Start Rolling  
To start rolling, go to either the Small Jar or the Collector's Signboard and click on their shops. Scroll down to where the option to buy relics/depth relics is visible. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Click **Start Rolls** and immediately tab into Nightreign. Borderless Windowed makes this less annoying since you can have Relic Reroller on top of Nightreign and then simply click behind it to tab back in. If you tab too slowly, there will be a warning that the Relics and Depth Relic buying options cannot be found on your screen.
The tool will now start rerolling your relics for the specified amount. Press "p" to interrupt the rolling.

# Useful Info and Warnings
Please read this even if you read nothing else so you do not waste your currency or otherwise somehow bug the program.

### **Warnings**
* If you have Confirmation Window setting turned on and are fullscreen it will freeze the game and try to tab you into the confirmation. I heavily recommend you play Borderless Window when using this tool
* If your resolution is not 1920x1080 the tool may not be able to recognize relic effects. I didn't bother to test lower resolutions. I heavily recommend you play in 1920x1080
* The app will always attempt to buy 10 relics without checking if your inventory can accept them or if you have enough currency. Make sure you have space and currency to buy them manually before using this tool
* The "Number of Times to Reroll" setting refers to how many times it buys relics. This means that putting 2 in this field will buy 20 relics. Make sure you understand how many relics it's going to buy
* Save/Load Presets saves/loads your settings. If you set 100 rerolls then start over and load in your old presets it will reroll 100 times. Make sure to check your settings before starting rolls
* Don't move the mouse too much after accepting the confirmation window for a relic. My script tries to move the mouse back but you can keep moving it and it will bug out
* **[EXTRA IMPORTANT]:** Test this tool yourself before leaving it unsupervised. Create a Preset with just "Vigor Up" and roll some normal relics and make sure that the confirmation window and everything pops up. Test the Interrupt function. I do not want my tool to waste all your currency because of some kind of hardware difference that I couldn't test

### **Useful Info**
* Rerolls will run significantly faster if you structure them to have fewer effects on top. For example, if I want a Revenant Night Invader roll, I should put only Night Invader in the first slot and secondary effects (starting incant, Rev specific effects, affinity attack up) in the second slot
* Press "p" to interrupt relic rerolling. Be patient, if you have many Relic Presets it may take a moment to interrupt, but it will not delete more relics or close relic window after you try to interrupt.


If you try to come to me and ask about something already answered or warned about here I will laugh at you, so be sure to read it! Otherwise, please enjoy my Nightreign Relic Reroller!
