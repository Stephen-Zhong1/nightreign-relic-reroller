# How to use Nightreign Relic Reroller
So I have a shiny new download of Relic Reroller. How do I start?

## Creating a Relic Preset
You will first want to create a (or multiple) Relic Preset that the app will attempt to roll for you.

This will create a new empty Relic Preset.

1. Depth Checkbox: This determines whether or not this Relic Preset is a Depth Relic. Depth Relics have different effects and also the option to pick curses to exclude. A Depth Relic Preset will be skipped when rolling normal relics and vice versa.
2. Name: Editable text field to name your Relic Preset
3. Edit: Opens a new window to edit your Relic Preset
4. Delete: Opens a confirmation window to delete your Relic Preset

You can create as many Relic Presets as you want, and also save and load them at any time with the "Save Setup" and "Load Setup" options. These options will save/load all current Relic Presets. 
Beware that these options will also save/load your settings. Be sure to check them before going to roll.

## Customizing your Relic Preset
So I've clicked **Edit Relic Preset**. This will pull up a new window to select effects for your Relic Preset.

Now we must select effects for each slot of the Relic Preset. Clicking **Edit Relic Effects** will allow you to select effects for the slot that you picked. You can select any number of effects. 
Beware that selecting too many can significantly slow down how fast the app runs. 
I am a Recluse main. Let's say I want to roll a relic that powers up Crystalian and Carian sorceries.

My Relic Preset now has a slot that looks for either Improved Crystalian or Carian Sword Sorceries.

Let's say I'm very greedy and want more than that. I want a godroll that has one of those bonuses as well as another useful bonus.
