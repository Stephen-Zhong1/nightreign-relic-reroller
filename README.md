# Buwum's Nightreign Relic Reroller
Nightreign Relic Reroller is an application designed to automate the rerolling process for relics in Elden Ring Nightreign. 

This app allows you to create **Relic Presets** which are essentially collections of relic effects that you want to roll for. When starting the rerolling process, the app will then automatically buy relics and sell any that do not match up with one of your Relic Presets. Relic Reroller also supports saving and loading Relic Presets so that you can swap between relics to roll or share your presets with friends.

To download Relic Reroller, follow these instructions: 
* Click **Nightreign Relic Roller.exe** in the above list of files
* Click **...** in the top right corner
* Click **Download**
The resulting exe can be run out of the box.
