# Buwum's Nightreign Relic Reroller
Nightreign Relic Reroller is an application designed to automate the rerolling process for relics in Elden Ring Nightreign. 

This app allows you to create **Relic Presets** which are essentially collections of relic effects that you want to roll for. When starting the rerolling process, the app will then automatically buy relics and sell any that do not match up with one of your Relic Presets. Relic Reroller also supports saving and loading Relic Presets so that you can swap between relics to roll or share your presets with friends.

To download Relic Reroller, follow these instructions: 
* Click **Nightreign Relic Roller.exe** in the above list of files
* Click **...** in the top right corner
* Click **Download**
  
The resulting exe can be run out of the box.


For a guide on how to use Relic Reroller, see [Relic Reroller User Guide](https://github.com/Stephen-Zhong1/nightreign-relic-reroller/blob/main/USER_GUIDE.md). **I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU AT LEAST SKIM THIS!! I also recommend you use 1920x1080 resolution and Borderless Windowed while using this tool.**

# Q & A
## **Will I get banned? Is this cheating?**
You will not be banned. As you might know, there is a way to directly cheat relics with whatever effect you want into the game, and people doing that have not been banned despite directly violating TOS. This tool does not violate TOS unless Fromsoft were to contact me saying it does.

1. This tool does nothing in expedition
2. This tool is strictly third-party and does not interact with Nightreign's code at all
3. See above
4. This tool **can only do things the player can do**. I.E. buy and sell relics
5. As I mentioned, Fromsoft would have to contact me

As for if this is cheating, I think not. Part of the reason I created this project is that relic cheaters are a pretty common problem, and some members of the community even openly defend it. A common argument is that the relic system is deeply flawed and cheating is a way to "fix" it. While I obviously don't agree that that justifies cheating, it is true that the gameplay loop of rerolling is extremely tedious and a chore especially if you have millions of murk like me. This tool automates that **while not doing anything the player themselves cannot do.** In addition, unlike a macro in a fighting game, it does not help overcome any sort of skill or execution barrier, it only alleviates the busywork of rerolling.

**I STRONGLY CONDONE CHEATING.** I genuinely believe that this tool is not cheating and I hope that by creating this and releasing it to the community that cheaters will become less prevalent.

## **Why can't I find [so-and-so] effect?**
The way my script is set up, I have to personally actually roll the effect before I can add it. After about 250k murk spent I just gave up looking for Evergaol bonus for example. I also excluded some effects that are essentially filler such as Intelligence+3.

## **It doesn't work**
The exe is packaged and tested only on Windows 11. If you are on Mac or Linux I am pretty sure it will not work. There may also be other issues that pop up on different hardware. Join my Discord and contact me to work something out.
